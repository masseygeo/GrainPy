## About The Project
There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

## Getting Started
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation
_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```

## Example
The idea for GrainPy started with an abundance of grain size distribution data that wasn't being fully utilized. The basic functionality of GrainPy is explained below, however, please refer to the [documentation](https://example.com) for more detailed information and tutorials.

### Data Structure
Grain size distribution data can be collected from a variety of methods, including sieve analysis, hydrometer method, and laser diffraction particle size analyzer. GrainPy uses the raw data from any type of analysis to be organized in an Excel table (.xlsx or .xls) consisting of the bins used for the analysis and the data collected for each bin (relative percentage).

### Grain Size Distributions
Grain size data can then be compiled into a usable format with GrainPy, used to calculate a variety of statistics, and produce publication-quality grain size distribution plots of individual or multiple samples.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Initial build
- [ ] Public release 0.1.0
- [ ] Added functionalities
     - [ ] Object compatibility with multiple types/sources of grain size distribution data
     - [ ] More geotechnical statistics
     - [ ] Multiple object comparitive plots and distributions (MLR? PCA?)
     - [ ] Sediment mixing models
- [ ] Integrate with GIS

See the [open issues](https://github.com/masseygeo/GrainPy/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
