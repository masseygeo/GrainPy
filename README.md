## About
GrainPy is a Python package for compiling, analyzing, visualizing, and interpreting grain size distribution data. The idea for GrainPy started with an abundance of grain size distribution data that wasn't being fully utilized. Initially, GrainPy was developed to quickly compare multiple grain size distribution analyses with geologic statistics and publication-quality plots. It is now evident that the potential for modern grain size analyses extends well beyond these basic, yet necessary, features, and GrainPy will continue to add user-friendly functionality.

### Features
      
<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



## Getting Started

### Installation
We reccomend installation using Conda as below...
```
conda install python=3 grainpy
```

### Examples
The basic functionality of GrainPy is explained below, however, please refer to the [documentation](https://example.com) for more detailed information and tutorials.

_**Grain size distribution data compilation**_
> Grain size distribution data comes from a variety of methods, including sieve, hydrometer, and laser diffraction particle size analyses. GrainPy collects and organizes this data (table of bins used and percentages) for single or multiple samples, calculates cumulative percentages, and a variety of sample statistics.
> 
> _images of input table...and output tables (data, cumulative, stats)_

_**Grain size distribution curves**_
> Grain size data can then be compiled into a usable format with GrainPy, used to calculate a variety of statistics, and produce publication-quality grain size distribution plots of individual or multiple samples.
> 
> _image of single plot...and multi plot_

## Roadmap
- [ ] Initial build
- [ ] Package 0.1.0 release
- [ ] Compatibility with multiple types/sources of grain size distribution data
- [ ] Additional statistics
- [ ] Comparison of multiple objects (More plots? MLR? PCA?)
- [ ] Sediment mixing models
- [ ] Integrate with GIS

See the [open issues](https://github.com/masseygeo/GrainPy/issues) for a list of features currently in development.
