## About
GrainPy is a Python package for compiling, analyzing, visualizing, and interpreting grain size distribution data. The idea for GrainPy started with an abundance of grain size distribution data that wasn't being fully utilized. Initially, GrainPy was developed to quickly compare multiple grain size distribution analyses with geologic statistics and publication-quality plots. GrainPy will continue to add modern, user-friendly tools for the interpretation and presentation of sediment analyses.

## Installation
TBD...

## Examples
The basic functionality of GrainPy is explained below, however, please refer to the [documentation](https://example.com) for more detailed information and tutorials.

### Data compilation
Grain size distribution data comes from a variety of methods, including sieve, hydrometer, and laser diffraction particle size analyses. GrainPy collects and organizes this data (table of bins used and percentages) for single or multiple samples, calculates cumulative percentages, and a variety of sample statistics.

> </p>
> 
> _Multiple raw data tables collected from grain size measurements (left) are collected and compiled by GrainPy into usable compilation tables of the data, cumulative frequencies, and statistics (right)._

### Grain size distribution plots
Data can then be visualized and interpreted with publication-quality grain size distribution plots.

> _Single samples can be plotted (left) to show histogram of binned data, cumulative percentage curve, vertical lines for mean, median, and modes. Multiple sample plots (right) show cumulative frequencies of all samples, the mean, and a 95% confidence interval._
