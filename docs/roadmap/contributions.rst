   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.


Contributions
=============

It is very much hoped that users of GrainPy will suggest improvements and/or new functionalities by one of two methods:

1. Simply `create a new issue <https://github.com/masseygeo/GrainPy/issues/new>`_ with the appropriate 'label' on Github.

**...OR...**

2. Personally contributing to the coding using a fork...

::

   # create a branch
   git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature

   # develop the feature code and commit your changes
   git commit -m 'Added this new feature that does amazing things'

   # push to the branch
   git push origin feature/amazingfeature

   # finally, `create a pull request on the GrainPy Github repo page
