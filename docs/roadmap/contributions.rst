Contributions
=============

It is very much hoped that users of GrainPy will suggest new functionalities by either...

1. `creating a new issue on Github <https://github.com/masseygeo/GrainPy/issues/new>`_


2. Personally contributing to the coding...

::

   # create a branch
   git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature

   # develop the feature code and commit your changes
   git commit -m 'Added this new feature that does amazing things'

   # push to the branch
   git push origin feature/amazingfeature

   # finally, `create a pull request on the GrainPy Github repo page
