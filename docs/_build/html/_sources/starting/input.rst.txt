Data Input
==========

Grain size distribution data can be obtained from a variety of equipment, including sieves, hydrometers, and laser diffraction particle size analyzers. GrainPy collects and organizes this data for single or multiple samples, calculates cumulative percentages, and a variety of sample statistics, however, there are a few basic requirements for the input data structure.

1. Currently, GrainPy only accepts Excel files (.xlsx or .xls). This will be updated to include Comma Separated Value files (.csv) soon, and other file formats if there is interest.

2. Each file contains data for one sample only.
